    Paging with ajax now works perfectly in the user administration panel. You can now also add profile pictures to accounts which also creates and saves a small thumbnail image of the profile picture to the database which is used when searching for users during image tagging. this solves the issue where you cant tell the difference between two users with the same name

    Functional prototype of the image tagging system is up. you can now tag images and then retrieve them from the database and display the images again regardless of the displayed size of the image. Still a lot can be done tomake it better, but it's working as intended

    Significantly improved tag boxes look and feel. You can now add custom boxes by doubbleclicking on images and tagboxes can be resized and moved aswell as removed. when typing in the input field of tagboxes an ajax call goes to the server and gets the names that starts with what you typed. Clicking the detect faces button will attempt to detect and add tags automatically to the image. finally tags are now saved to the database and can be retrieved when the image is requested from the database again

    after a lot of work and nothing working the tagging system still does not work, but at least I can now display images before uploading them and then upload them asynchronously with ajax to the database. can also display progress. this has turned out to be a lot harder than expected...
